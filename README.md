wireless tools for wireless administration 

While studying for the my CWNA the first few chapters add a bit of math and...I was lazy and didn't want to do it so I 
wrote a small python file to do the math for me. 

### RFMath.py

To run it simply execute the file. 
```
./rfmath.py
```

### Wireless_network.py

This is a small script that takes the default Kismet.netxml and parses through it. Limited options include SSID details, 
BSSID, Frequency, Channel, Carrier, and Encoding. 

File will ask for the path and file name and enjoy my poor coding :)

  ```
  ./wireless_network.py
  ```
